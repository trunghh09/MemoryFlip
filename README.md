## MEMORY FLIP PROJECT

### INTRODUCTION

> Memory Flip is classic brain-training game that challenges players to test and improve memory skills. In the game, a set of cards is placed face down on the screen. Each card has a matching paor with the same image or symbol. Players flip two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they remain face up; if not, they are flipped back down.
>
> The goal of the game is to match all pairs in the fewest moves and shortest time possible. As the levels process, the number of cards increases, making the game more challenging. Memory Flip is fun, easy to play and suitable for players of all ages, helping to improve concertration, memory and cognitive skills.
